### Requirement Clarity

* High Priority -> Fine-Grained Requirements (Tasks) 
* Medium Priority -> Medium-Grained Requirements (User Stories)
* Low Priority -> Coarse-Grained Requirements (Epic)


### Breakdown (JIT Definition / Deep Dive)

1. Identify Initial Scope
2. Classify Requirement Clarity (Task/Story/Epic)
3. Confirm Definition of Done (all activities to bring to shippable state)
4. Frame a Model to Size the stories
  * Spike Sample
  * Task Breakdown / Story Splitting
  * Team Conscience
  * Expert Opinion
5. Compute Total Story Points and Share (Add buffers based on clarity)
