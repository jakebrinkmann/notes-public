Base/Reference Story: One that all in the team can relate to. Sizing should be compared to that baseline (from current, or previous sprint)

Relative Scale | Type
-|-
0.5 ideal day | Task
1 ideal day | Task
2 ideal days | Task
3 pts | Story
5 pts | Story
8 pts | Story
13 pts | Story
20 / Small (weeks) | Feature
40 / Medium (months) | Epic
100 / Large (quarters) | Theme

* Relative Effort/Complexity - Stories
* Absolute Ideal Time - Tasks

### Complexity Buckets

* Light -> +1
* Medium -> +2
* High -> +3
* Complex -> +5

Try reorienting estimation away from "How long will this take?", and towards "How much do we know about this?"

The more you can know (or access), the better you can anticipate & predict

1. Just about everyone in the world has done this
2. Lots of people have done this, including someone on our team
3. Someone in our company has done this, or we have access to expertise
4. Someone in the world did this, but not in our organization (and probably at a competitor)
5. Nobody in the world has ever done this before
