Features are defined using a Features and Benefits (FAB) Matrix:
* Feature – A short phrase giving a name and context
* Benefit hypothesis – The proposed measurable benefit to the end user or business

Acceptance criteria are used to determine whether the implementation is correct and delivers the business benefits.

Capabilities must be decomposed into features to be implemented. They, in turn, are split into stories consumable by teams within an iteration.
