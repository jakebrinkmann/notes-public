> think of cards as tokens promising a future conversation, the details can be elaborated through conversations with the customer

Three points for a JIRA card are:

* ðŸŽ¯ **Mission**: What needs to be done?
  > what should be achieved? what problem or need are you trying to solve or fulfill?
  
* ðŸ”¨ **Method**: Can this work?
  > How is the goal met? High level ideas for possible solutions.
  
* ðŸ“Š **Metrics**: Is it testable?
  > How do we determine if the goal has been met? Understand if and to which extend you have met the goal.
  
# 3C's

* **Card**: As a "user" I want to "function" so I can "value"
* **Conversation**: Detailed description. step-by-step execution, basic flow, alternative scenarios, mock-up design. 
* **Confirmation**: Passed and accepted if specific criteria fulfilled in execution

# INVEST in Good Stories, and SMART Tasks

* **I** â€“ Independent: not overlap in concept, implement in any order
* **N** â€“ Negotiable: captures the essence, not the details
* **V** â€“ Valuable: framed in a way that makes the customer perceive them as important
* **E** â€“ Estimable: help the customer rank and schedule the storyâ€™s implementation
* **S** â€“ Small: not too hard to know whatâ€™s in the storyâ€™s scope
* **T** â€“ Testable: learn the true needs

  .

* **S** â€“ Specific: everyone can understand whatâ€™s involved
* **M** â€“ Measurable: can we mark it as done?
* **A** â€“ Achievable: expect to be able to achieve a task
* **R** â€“ Relevant: can be explained and justified to customer
* **T** â€“ Time-boxed: an expectation so people know when they should seek help

* If it's __risky to__ specify precisely, __DO NOT__ specify
  * (e.g., GUI layout, COTS behavior)
